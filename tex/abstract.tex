The new features of HTML5 offer new possibilities for developers. The new
canvas element in combination with JavaScript can be used to develop
multimedia applications and games for the browser. The result is the
progress of the internet independent from Adobe Flash, which possibly means
that Adobe Flash can be replaced by HTML5.
\newline\newline
This paper compares the core technologies of HTML5 and
Adobe Flash, pointing out how HTML5 and Adobe Flash can
be used at present and which of the two technologies has a greater potential
for the future. On the basis of practical implementations, the advantages and
disadvantages of both competitors are shown and rough guidelines are be
given for the choice of which technology can be preferably used for which
project.
\newline\newline
Analyses based on practical implementations in the field of multimedia and
games include a discussion of the results and future perspectives of the two
technologies.
